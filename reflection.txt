Write a few sentences about your coding experience here (The difficulty level of this project for you, how this project improved your learning object-oriented programming in C++.)) (at least five sentences to get full points )

Your reflection :
The level of this project was about a 6.8/10 suprisingly, after how challenging I found the last project.
This project solidified some of the understanding on how c++ works in the background. I had lots of trouble
with zyook as I usually do, but it helped me understand zylab better as well. I now have a much better understanding
of how you can use objects within other objects. After this code, I have a much better understanding of how and where  
certain variables are accessable. As well, this project has helped me understand how important it is to come up with 
a plan when coding bigger projects. As you can see in my code a couple methods are a lot longer than the others. 
This is because I did the whole project in one method and the split it up into parts. This made the project twice as 
difficult, and I will never make that mistake again. I also grasped a better understanding of Makefiles and how they
work in coherision with modular compiling.
